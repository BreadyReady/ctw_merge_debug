Some of the files here in gfx/interface are used by the game for gfx usage. An exmple is the debug dog that the game will use to show errors in debug gameplay seccsions. For nearly all of them, the name of the file is important as that is where the game will look for the image needed. (At this time, it is unknonw if this can be chnaged.)

Debug Dog:
Will require image for it to be 93x122, saved as a dss file, and also be named "thisisdog.dds" for the game to chose the file wanted. (For themeing, please make sure to have what character used as dog to have the fex. Use provided paint.net file thisis_.pdn as a template

Console Command Window
This is the window shown for console command when you press tidla ~. Normally, there is also a small avator themed dog there. File name is "console_win_bg.dds". Image size is 500x412. Use console_win_bg.pdn as a template. Do not some the orignal window frame as that might effect text readability when in game.
