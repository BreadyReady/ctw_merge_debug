mewni_corn_crisis_news_event.1.d:0 "Extreme news has come from the Butterfly Kingdom today. The Kingdom's Corn supply, the crop which they base their entire economy on, has been comprimised! Thousands of pounds of corn are going missing, with entire silos being found full one day and then empty the next!\n\nIt is beleived by the Magic High Commision that a new family of rats is the culprit, and they are working hard to stop them. However, these rats are extremeley well organized, and will likley be able to evade eradication for the forseeable future.\n\nThe populace is already preparing for the worst, hiding corn under mattreses and stockpiling weapons in case of societal collapse."
mewni_corn_crisis_news_event.1.a:0 "OH GOD, NOT THE CORN MARKET!"
mewni_corn_crisis_news_event.1.c:0 "How Terrible!"

mewni_corn_crisis_news_event.2.t:0 "The Corn Crisis: Unemployed Mercanaries"
mewni_corn_crisis_news_event.2.d:0 "With the Corn Crisis making the government demand every peasant work the fields as hard as thay can, other fields of work have been neglected. One of these is the Mewman guard, and with a lack of money the government had no choice but to let off the majority of mercanaries. This has backfired though, as throwing thousands of trained warriors out onto the street was not a good idea.\n\nRobbery, burglary, extortion, and black market supply are all up. Gangs are forming, with organized raids on both civillian and government warehouses being carried out. And with the imperial police department lacking funds, they seem unlikley to stop anytime soon."
mewni_corn_crisis_news_event.2.a:0 "Criminals!"

mewni_kingdom_collapse_news_event.1.d:0 "With the Butterfly Kingdom being split between King Ludo and Queen Moon, most of the vassal kingdoms have reacted harshly.\n\nThe Pigeon Kingdom, Ponyhead Kingdom, and the Lucitor Kingdom have declared absolute neutrality. The Spiderbite Kingdom has also declared neutrality, along with publishing a list of greivances citing why they did so. These include the numerous harsh worker mandates, Mewni's dependance on foreign aid, and the extremly suspicious dissapearance of the Queen mere days before the coup.\n\nHowever, in response to this, the Johansen Kingdom and the Jaggy Kingdom have declared that they will still fully support the queen."

mewni_kingdom_split_news_event.1.d:0 "Queen Moon has come out of hiding and, in a universal signal automatically playing on all magic mirrors, has declared Ludo as an ilegitimate King who has no right to rule Mewni!\n\nAlready, a border between the Queen's supporters and Ludo's loyalists has formed. Grand armies are mobilizing on both sides, arms companies are going into overdrive, and journalists are buying years' worth of bulletproof vests.\n\nIt is clear to everyone where all of this will lead: total war on Mewman home soil."
mewni_kingdom_split_news_event.1.a:0 "We will drive this invader out of our lands!"

mewni_butterfly_front_news_event.1.d:0 "With the vassal states breaking every precedent and abandoning the Butterfly dynasty, the Kingdom of Mewni is effectivley just a name. The Queen's reaction to this is a reforming of the Kingdom, temporarily giving the remaining vassal states more power and freedom.\n\nThe Kingdom has also rebranded, changing their name to "The Butterfly Front." And although it has only existed for a few days, it already has it's own "anthem" of sorts."
mewni_butterfly_front_news_event.1.a:0 ""For The Queen!""

mewni_ludo_coup_news_event.1.d:0 "In a sudden coup, a monster by the name of Ludo Avarius has taken control of Butterfly Castle! Details are scarce, but it is beleived that Ludo snuck in through an open door and took the city from the inside. He has taken most government officials hostage in the dungeon, and has even imprisoned an American 14 years of age. It is beleived that King River, who was ruling as regent, has been imprisoned as well. The whereabouts of Queen Moon is unknown as she had left the castle a few days before the coup, along with the Magic High Commision.\n\nQuestions are swirling about why Queen Moon's departure was so mysterious, along with when she will make her next appearance, if ever. How the vassal kingdoms will react remains to be seen."

jaggy_collapse_news_event.1.d:0 "The nothern most Mewman vassal kingdom, the Jaggy Kingdom, has collapsed! With supply lines unable to reach the unfarmable mountains of the Jaggy Kingdom, starvation has engulfed the sparse populace and raiding of government food stocks has become common place. Information from the kingdom in few and far between, but it is currently beleived that Crown Princess Jags has fled over-dimensions.\n\nThis leaves the kingdom in a state of absolute anarchy, and factions are sure to start forming. However, the fog of war has obscured any information coming out of the reigon."

mewni_ludo_war_start_news_event.1.d:0 "Some say the Queen started it, a peasant brigade getting unruly and crossing the border. Some say Ludo started it, a team of rats ambushing a peasant. But at this point it doesn't matter, the civil war has started.\n\nAlready, swarms of rats pour out into the country side as mewman peasants stand to face them. The last time a war was fought on Mewman homelands was 500 years ago, even Solaria's generation never knew what war on home soil would be like. However, this generation will."
mewni_ludo_war_start_news_event.1.a:0 "We will reclaim the Mewman homelands from this usurper! For the Queen!"
