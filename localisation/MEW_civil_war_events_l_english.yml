tsr_alliance_proposal.1.d:0 "The recent civil strife in the Kingdom of Mewni is growing more and more desperate, and as the fate of the Mewman state hangs in the balance we have been given a unique oppurtunity. A Mewman delegate has come to the cream-lin, and is asking for our support in the inevitable conflict. \nOn one hand, if we side with Mewni and they win, we would be seen in great favor by them. We might even be formally entered into the Kingdom of Mewni, being given the same privleges as the other monster kingdoms underneath them. On the other hand, we would be serving our historical oppressers, who we only knelt to in the past for our own survival."

As the Johansen Kingdom recognizes us as their superior, we have ultimate say in this matter despite Boggabah being owned by them. Although this problem may arise in the future, once we win the civil war and we are no longer united by a common enemy. \n\nHow should we respond?"
tsr_wants_land.1.a:0 "Your terms are acceptable. Welcome to the Butterfly Front!"

uneasy_peace.1.t:0 "The Uneasy Peace"
uneasy_peace.1.d:0 "Along the border between Ludo's Loyalists and Moon's resistance, guards on each side exchange tense glances and stares. Most soldiers on both sides have never seen combat, the most one could have ever seen would be a bar brawl. Almost all are hesitant to break the 300 years of peace, and both sides don't want to be labeled as the one who broke it."
uneasy_peace.1.a:0 "Good, it gives us more time to prepare."
