    EUS.1.t:0 "America, the Beautiful"
    EUS.1.d:0 "The United States, in spite of the turmoil of the last twenty years, still remains the premier superpower across the world. Seventy-Five Stars strong, the US was seen by many as the beacon and example of Freedom and Democracy when mankind entered the last decade of the 20th Century. After overwhelming victories against communism in Korea and Vietnam and the successful deployment of the SDI, Strategic Defense Initiative which rendered Nuclear Warfare a thing of the past, American victory in the Cold War should have brought about a new golden era in the West. Its economy was strong and the American backed Cross Atlantic Treaty Organization was the single dominant alliance on Earth. Its secret paranormal agency, the FPI, Federal Paranormal Investigations, has ensured no weirdness or interdimensional threat can interfere with its reign on Earth. American exceptionalism was at its strongest."

    EUS.2.t:0 "Why we can't have Nice Things"
    EUS.2.d:0 "Instead, though, the US would see an almost painful decline in status and prestige; it's true colors for all the world to see. With no rival power after the fall of the Soviet Union, the US SDI ended decades of MAD doctrine, giving its leaders near free use of nuclear weaponry with no fear of retaliation. Through strong arming and gunboat diplomacy, the US brought numerous new territories into the Union as states, going so far as to take advantage of conflicts like the Troubles and the Russian Civil War to annex new territory from ally and enemy alike. Its economic might would force the world to submit to US pressure and the power of the dollar and US corporations. Finally, its military would be undisputed in whereever it went and how it operated.\n\nIt would, however, be the disastrous intervention in the Gulf War that ended the short era of Pax Americana in the 90s. The world would see an embarrassing performance by the US military that saw nuclear bombardment just as a means of protecting US military withdraw. This massive destruction, crippling of the oil market, and refugee crisis would see Europe turn away from the US and form a federated European Union to counter the US. With the loss of Northern Ireland to the new American State of Ireland, Great Britain’s decline saw Canada overtake it as the new leader of the Imperial Commonwealth, giving a new superpower right across border to the US.\n\nThis all came to a head when the EU unveiled the EuroShield, a rival nuclear shield to the US SDI. While both systems could shoot down each other’s nuclear arsenal, it was the fact that the two systems could instead destroy each other and remove the shield meant that, in a split second, Mutually Assured Destruction was back on the table. Followed by the Commonwealth’s Rising Sun anti-nuclear system, the world entered a new psuedo cold war as the three main democratic superpowers turn on each other, the US vs the EU, with the IC as the only mediator strong enough to keep them at peace."

    EUS.3.t:0 "But Our Flag was still there"
    EUS.3.d:0 "Still, America holds great potential, and President Curtis, on the verge of a third term in an election year, was determined to see that through. Thanks to the US megacorporation Northwest Industry, the Spore Refinement Process was created. This allowed for the refining of common energy fungus into ethanol, ended the energy crisis and climate change. Freely given to the world, it restore American image at the turn of the century. In spite the new rivalry, the CATO still holds strong and maintains peace and democratic rule throughout the world while the League of Nations stands as strong as ever to bring diplomatic resolution to problems all around the world. Unbeknownst to even the world leaders, the American FPI, the European EIO, and the Commonwealth MI-13 still work hand-in-hand to protect humanity from the paranormal and otherworldly.\n\nBut as another year enters summer, past events and old grudges would still remain and it would take one failure, one disaster to undo the path to peace and bring the world closer than ever to a more conventional, and total, Armageddon."
